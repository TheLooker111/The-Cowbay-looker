    <h2>Mosher Family Interviews</h2>
    <p><strong>Clara Mosher (Peter's sister):</strong> "Peter was never the same after 1903. He used to write all night, saying he was trying to map something 'before it moved again'. I never saw the drawings. He burned them every morning."</p>
    <p><strong>Thomas Mosher (nephew):</strong> "They said Uncle Peter disappeared in the hills. But I swear, in '17, I saw him outside my window. He looked older than time, and his eyes… weren’t right."</p>
    <p><strong>Unnamed Family Member (redacted):</strong> "I kept one page of his notebook. Just one. It hums. No matter where I hide it, I hear it at night."</p>

  <div class="page" id="notebook">
    <h2>Notebook Fragments – Peter Mosher</h2>
    <p><strong>Entry dated October 4, 1902:</strong> "The Looker watches from the salt grass. My sketches no longer stay where I leave them. Something folds the corners... something reads."</p>
    <p><strong>Entry dated December 29, 1903:</strong> "He does not knock. He <em>leans</em>. He leans and waits until the air turns cold and time folds sideways."</p>
    <p><strong>Undated page (burned edges):</strong> "If I stare at the mirror long enough, the reflection twitches. It blinks when I don’t."</p>

    <h2>Collected Town Rumors</h2>
    <p>⟟ The old woman at Hollow Bend claimed her daughter vanished after singing by the window past midnight.</p>
    <p>⟟ A man named Curtis swore he locked every door and shutter — but still found rope fibers on his pillow.</p>
    <p>⟟ Locals say if you whisper “who’s looking” into the dark three times, your window latch loosens on its own.</p>
