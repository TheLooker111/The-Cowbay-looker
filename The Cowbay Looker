    <h2>Mosher Family Interviews</h2>
    <p><strong>Clara Mosher (Peter's sister):</strong> "Peter was never the same after 1903. He used to write all night, saying he was trying to map something 'before it moved again'. I never saw the drawings. He burned them every morning."</p>
    <p><strong>Thomas Mosher (nephew):</strong> "They said Uncle Peter disappeared in the hills. But I swear, in '17, I saw him outside my window. He looked older than time, and his eyes… weren’t right."</p>
    <p><strong>Unnamed Family Member (redacted):</strong> "I kept one page of his notebook. Just one. It hums. No matter where I hide it, I hear it at night."</p>
